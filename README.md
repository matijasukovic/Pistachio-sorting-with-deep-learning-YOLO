# Pistachio-sorting-with-deep-learning-and-YOLO-algorithm
This was a project I made for my Machine Learning subject at university. It expands on an existing dataset and utilizes YOLOv5 to create a powerful model for detecting and classifying open and closed pistachios.

*The original dataset was created by Mohammad Rahimzadeh and Abolfazl Attar. Find it at their GitHub: https://github.com/mr7495/Pesteh-Set.*

Expansion of the dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K1gpFXQIYkpzgdZqSn5ZLyOcDYYmihzz?usp=sharing

The combination of the original and expansion can be found at: https://universe.roboflow.com/pistachio-detection/pistachios
