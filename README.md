# Pistachio-sorting-with-deep-learning-and-YOLO-algorithm
This was a project I made for my Machine Learning subject at university. It expands on an existing dataset and utilizes YOLOv5 to create a powerful model for detecting and classifying open and closed pistachios.

*The original dataset was created by Mohammad Rahimzadeh and Abolfazl Attar. Find it at their GitHub: https://github.com/mr7495/Pesteh-Set.*
